# Efficient Data Stream Anomaly Detection

## Project Overview
This project implements a Python script for detecting anomalies in a continuous data stream. The stream simulates real-time sequences of floating-point numbers, incorporating seasonal patterns, random noise, and occasional spikes to represent anomalies.

## Features
- **Algorithm Selection**: Utilizes Isolation Forest for effective anomaly detection.
- **Data Stream Simulation**: Generates a data stream with seasonal patterns and random noise.
- **Real-Time Anomaly Detection**: Flags anomalies as data is streamed.
- **Visualization**: Displays the data stream and detected anomalies in real-time.

## Requirements
This project is implemented in Python 3.x and requires the following libraries:
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib` (for visualization)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Efficient-Data-Stream-Anomaly-Detection.git
   cd Efficient-Data-Stream-Anomaly-Detection
